    <h3>Description</h3>
    You'll only need five ingredients to make these irresistible deep-fried Oreos: vegetable oil (for frying and for the batter), milk, an egg, pancake mix, and a package of Oreos (regular and Double Stuf Oreos both work great). Try different Oreo flavors to switch things up! 
    It couldn't be simpler to make deep-fried Oreos at home: Make the batter, dip the cookies in the batter, and fry the cookies in batches until they're golden brown. Dust the finished Oreos with powdered sugar for a perfect presentation.
